<h1>Interactive Real-time Registration Graph</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Real-time Registration graph was created by the dev team at OTC Web Services to provide a friendly and engaging interface 
to the current registration trends at the OTC college.</p>
<p>By clicking the bars of the graph, a new graph is generated with the clicked bar as a parameter to 
a more specific dataset. For example, clicking the Math department bar (MTH) generates a new graph with the different Math classes
across the x-axis. Clicking on a Math class bar will, in turn, generate a graph with the sections of that class along the x-axis.</p>
<p>The graphs are drawn in the HTML5 canvas element, allowing users to dynamically create and download .png graphs in canvas supporting browsers.</p>
